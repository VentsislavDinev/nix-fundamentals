## We see a library from which several built-in functions derived and whose parameters are being inherited, is that correct?

## We see a defaultArgReducer function with conditional construction.
## This function reads a list, and if it is, then concatenate it to string.
## And if it is not a list then it converts it to string.

## The defaultPathReducer is a function concatenates strings to arguments with double dash
## The dotPathReducer is a function concatenates strings to arguments with a dot.

## The defaultArgFormatter is an attribute set with several parameteres, the last two of which call two functions accordingly.
